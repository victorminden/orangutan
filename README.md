# Orangutan: Writing an Interpreter/Compiler in Rust
This is a rust implementation of the "monkey" language interpreter from the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" and compiler from the book "Writing a Compiler in Go", both by Thorsten Ball.

The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) to familiarize myself with the rust language and (2) to familiarize myself with interpreters and compilers.

# Resources
While I try to implement everything myself, some inspiration has been drawn from the following sources (beyond the book):
